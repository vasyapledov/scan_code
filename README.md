INTRODUCTION
------------
Provides functionality for barcode's scanning -
scan barcodes using device camera.
You can update any `string_textfield` widget.
You can add this functionality to any other
text widget also.
Need to check - how it will work.

LINKS
------------

Project is based on
https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_pos
- submodule `barcode_scanning`.

Using external libraries:
 - https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2 (Quagga2)
 - https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js

REQUIREMENTS
------------

### Browser ####

Not all browsers support the webcam spec, IE11 and older will not support it,
but all modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and Safari will.

### Security ###

Most browsers will only allow you to access
the camera over a secure connection,
so you will need to run your site via https, even for
developmenÐµ environments unless they are hosted on localhost.
Some browsers, like Firefox, will allow you
to override this, but you have to do so on every page load.

INSTALLATION
------------
It is recommended to install the `Scan Code`
module via composer.
All external libraries will be installed during
modules installation process.

### Composer ###

   composer require "drupal/scan_code:^1.0"

to update to a new
release.
